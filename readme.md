Prometheus		Metrics			Collects metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and application-specific metrics. Helps in monitoring performance.
Grafana			Visualization		Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces. Integrates with Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger.
Promtail		Logs			Collects logs from containers and forwards them to Loki for log aggregation.
Loki			Logs			Stores and indexes logs, enabling log querying and analysis in Grafana.
Jaeger			Tracing			Enables distributed tracing, providing insights into the request flow and latency across microservices.
Sentry			Error Tracking		Captures errors, exceptions, and performance issues in real-time. Provides stack traces and context for debugging.
Alertmanager		Alerting		Works with Prometheus to send alerts based on metric thresholds (optional but recommended for alerting needs).
Node Exporter		Host Metrics		Collects system-level metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage for Prometheus from the Docker host.
Fluentd (optional)	Logs			An alternative log collector if more complex log processing (parsing, filtering) or multi-backend log forwarding is needed.
OpenTelemetry		Tracing (Optional)	Advanced trace collection, can export traces to Jaeger for more detailed tracing or send data to other backends.
Sentry Performance	Performance Tracing	Provides transaction tracing to identify slow API calls, bottlenecks, and overall application performance.
